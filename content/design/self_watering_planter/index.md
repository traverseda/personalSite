This is a self watering "Air Pruning" planter. It goes through water
fast because of the open sides. Open sides like this stimulates root
branching, leading to a dense root bulb without roots doubling back
on themselves. This makes plants becoming "root bound" less of 
a problem.

This design is parametric, you can resize it for any plant pot. It was
designed for 2L pop bottles. I also did a bonsai variant, but I found 
it dried out too frequintly.
