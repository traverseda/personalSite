This is a self watering "Air Pruning" planter. It goes through water
fast because of the open sides. Open sides like this stimulates root
branching, leading to a dense root bulb without roots doubling back
on themselves. This makes plants becoming "root bound" less of 
a problem.

This design is parametric, you can resize it for any plant pot.
